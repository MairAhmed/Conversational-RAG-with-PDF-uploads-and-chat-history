# Conversational-RAG-with-PDF-uploads-and-chat-history
This project demonstrates a Conversational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enhances AI-driven conversations by incorporating external knowledge from uploaded PDFs and previous chat history. Users can interact with the system in a natural language format, where the model retrieves relevant information from PDFs and past dialogues to provide accurate and context-aware responses.

Key Features:

PDF Integration: Users can upload PDFs, which are processed and indexed for efficient retrieval during conversations.

Chat History Utilization: The system keeps track of previous interactions, enabling it to maintain context and provide more coherent and personalized responses.

RAG Model Implementation: Combines retrieval-based and generative approaches to generate answers that are informed by the uploaded documents and chat history.

Flexible Application: Can be used for various applications, including customer support, research assistance, and educational tools.

This project aims to bridge the gap between static document retrieval and dynamic conversational AI by leveraging both document content and interaction history.
